# Developer documentation

## Development tools

In order to work on Pioneer 2 you'll need following tools for development and testing:

- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) `v14.x`
- [yarn classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) package manager `v1.22.x`

In order to interact with the Joystream ecosystem

- [Joystream node](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/tree/master/node) _optional_
- [Joystream query-node](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/tree/query_node/query-node) _optional_

## Tech stack

The Pioneer 2.0 is build using the latest version of [React](https://reactjs.org/). The React development assumes:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 4.x – using `sctrict:true`
- Function components & [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [styled components](https://styled-components.com/docs) for CSS

Libraries

- [Apollo client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) - to interact with GraphQL
- [CKEditor 5](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/overview.html) as Markdown editor
- [xstate](https://xstate.js.org/) state management for complex flows in modals
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup#api) validation (partially)
- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/docs/Getting-Started) to interact with dates
- React libraries for: routing, pagination, breadcrumbs, dropzone, etc (see package.json)

**Note**: To read about the Pioneer 2 architecture & key concepts see [Pioneer 2 readme](packages/ui/README.md)

### Dependencies

The package.json entries for `@polkadot/*` packages must be set to the exact versions in order to match Joystream dependencies. See `resolutions` section in [package.json](/package.json) for details. Keeping dependencies in sync prevents "duplicated instances" error while using Polkadot.js API.

### Build tools

The build scripts uses webpack directly (no CRA) as it integrates better with custom webpack extensions (build CKEditor, etc.).

As the Storybook uses Babel a [shared webpack configuration](packages/ui/dev/webpack.shared.js) for both webpack and storybook was introduced.

To build the project in a development mode using webpack dev server:

```shell
yarn run start
```

To build a production ready version:

```shell
yarn run build
```

## Coding standards

For code quality & standards we rely on ESLint and Prettier. To run both checks execute inside `packages/ui`:

```shell
## Run linter
yarn lint

## Run lint & apply automatic fixes
yarn lint:fix
```

## Testing

See [testing documentation](tests.md)

## Joystream API

Both - the testnet & local development environment expects that a Joystream node instance is available.

Expected URIs:

- local: `ws://127.0.0.1:9944`
- testnet: `wss://olympia-dev.joystream.app`

### Local environment limitations

Since the local query-node operates on [mocks](mocks#query-node-mocks) all of the query-node mocked entities are not present on-chain.

Also, any The second limitation is that any on-chain action is not represented in the query-node mocks.

See [mocking](mocks.md) on how to work with local mocks for development and tests.

## Query-node API

To access the archival state of the chain Pioneer 2 fetch such information from the [query-node](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/tree/query_node/query-node). It is a GraphQL server that allows a convenient API for querying the data.

The following tools are used to consume GraphQL data:
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) for accessing GraphQL

### Adding queries

To fetch the data from a GraphQL we use code generated by [GraphQL Code Generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/)

To generate scripts run:

```shell
yarn run queries:generate
```

The queries are organized as below:
- The query-node schema is stored under [@/common/api/schema.graphql](packages/ui/src/common/api/schemas/schema.graphql)
- GraphQL's queries are stored per every module, inside `@/module/queries/` folder - you only need to modify those.
- The `graphq-codegen` will generate React hooks for Apollo Client ([plugin `typescript-react-apollo`](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/docs/plugins/typescript-react-apollo)) that will be exposed as `@/module/queries` import.

For instance, to query for `memberships`:

Create a `@/memberships/queries/members.graphql` file:

```graphql
query GetMembers {
  memberships {
    id
    handle
  }
}
```

Then run the `yarn run queries:generate` script.

Use the generated hook in your code:

```ts
import { useGetMembersQuery } from '@/memberships/queries'

const { loading, data } = useGetMembersQuery()
```

### Code generation

Some GraphQL related tools use code generation to scaffold types and react hooks from GraphQL schemas and queries.

After updating `packages/ui/src/api` any of `*.graphql` files run `yarn queries:generated` script in the UI package.

# Tips & Tricks

## Connecting to the Joystream node using Polkadot app wallet

You can use the Polkadot apps wallet to browse the Joystream node state and call all available extrinsic.

In order to use the app with Joystream API types you need to upload the correct type `defs.json` from the Joystream repo (using proper branch as well). The full path to file is: `/types/augment/all/defs.json`.

For the `olympia_dev` branch the `defs.json` use this [link](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/blob/olympia_dev/types/augment/all/defs.json):

1. Copy the contents of the [`raw view`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joystream/joystream/olympia_dev/types/augment/all/defs.json).
2. Paste to the input on Settings > Developer tab
3. Switch to a network
   1. [local](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944)
   2. [olympia testnet](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Folympia-dev.joystream.app%2Frpc)
