# Developer documentation

## Development tools

In order to work on Pioneer 2 you'll need following tools for development and testing:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) `v18.x` or newer.
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

In order to interact with the Joystream ecosystem

- [Joystream node](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/tree/master/bin/node) _optional_
- [Joystream Query node](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/tree/master/query-node) _optional_

## Pioneer architecture

Pioneer is an application which displays information from and interacts with the Joystream node. This is done in a few way throughout the code base:
- It mostly interacts directly with the Joystream node by calling extrinsics via the [Polkadot{.js} API](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api).
- Data are mostly done through the Query Node GraphQL API. However occasionally some data are also read via [Polkadot{.js} API](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api) queries.
- Pioneer also connect to the [Membership Faucet](https://github.com/Joystream/membership-faucet) to creates memberships.

In addition to these services 3 services memberships Avatars are uploaded and served by `https://atlas-services.joystream.org/avatars`.

Finally Pioneer is composed of 2 services a front-end application and a back-end which handle e-mail notifications. They interact via GraphQL.

Here is a summary of the involved services:

### Pioneer front-end App

 To start Pioneer run:
 ```shell
 yarn start
 ```

As shown above the Pioneer front-end relies the state of the Joystream blockchain (exposed by the Joystream node and query node). Therefore it is necessary to connect Pioneer to instances of the Joystream node and query node or to mock these in order to be able to develop on Pioneer.

- #### Method 1: Develop using Storybook

   The Pioneer Storybook has several stories rendering entire pages including the pages modal. This can be used to add features and tests. It allows to easily mock any possible chain state and can result in a faster development cycle.

   To start Storybook run:
   ```shell
   yarn storybook
   ```

   It should be accessible at `localhost:6006`.
   There are to section particularly useful to develop:
   1. [App](https://pioneer-2-storybook-joystream.vercel.app/?path=/story/app) these stories allow to interact with non domain specific feature like the On boarding flow or the sidebar.
   2. [Pages](https://pioneer-2-storybook-joystream.vercel.app/?path=/story/pages) these stories render the pages based on fully mocked data (which can partially be changed through the stories controls).

   > **Warning**
   > After developing a feature using a story, the feature should still be tested on the app with an actual network.

   Read more about the Storybook mocks [here](mocks.md#storybook-mocks).

- #### Method 2: Connect to the Joystream main network (Mainnet)

   Pioneer will by default connect to the Joystream main network. This can be enough to develop or develop feature based on the current version of the Mainnet chain, however changing state of the Mainnet for development is costly, time consuming, and should be avoided in most cases.

   > **Note**
   > To make sure that Pioneer is connected to the Mainnet go to the Settings on the "Network" tab the "Select Network" should be set to "Mainnet". Additionally "Network Details" section (on the same page) can be checked to make sure the environment variable are indeed pointing to the Mainnet.

- #### Method 3: Connect to a Joystream playgrounds

   Alternatively some "playground" are available to help with Pioneer's development, these are networks based on chains with tokens which have no real values and which might be configured to make testing easier (e.g election cycle may run in minutes instead of weeks).

   Read how to connect to these networks [here](/packages/ui/README.md#using-custom-joystream-networks).

- #### Method 4: Connect to a local Joystream dev environment

   Read the [Running the Joystream ecosystem locally](testenv.md) docs on how to run Pioneer with the Joystream testnet locally.

Read more about the Pioneer front-end App architecture and key concepts [here](/packages/ui/README.md).

### Pioneer back-end

Read about the Pioneer backend architecture and key concepts [here](/packages/server/README.md).


## Testing

Read about testing in [testing documentation](tests.md).

## Coding standards

For code quality & standards we rely on ESLint and Prettier. To run both checks execute inside `packages/ui`:

```shell
## Run linter
yarn lint

## Run lint & apply automatic fixes
yarn lint:fix
```

## Dependencies

The package.json entries for `@polkadot/*` packages must be set to the exact versions in order to match Joystream dependencies. See `resolutions` section in [package.json](/package.json) for details. Keeping dependencies in sync prevents "duplicated instances" error while using Polkadot.js API.

The CKEditor 5 build is available in `packages/markdown-editor` packages. [More on editor development](/packages/markdown-editor/README.md).
