              The Joystream blockchain is a PoS system relying on validators. Nominating validators allows you to
              participate in the Joystream governance system and earn rewards.

              When nominating, you are at risk of having parts of your staked funds lost if the validator malfunctions
              or does a poor job, resulting in a reduced return on investment. To manage your risk, we advice you to
              nominate several validators (up to 16). This allows you to spread out your risk and increase your chances
              of earning rewards. You can choose how much to stake with each validator, and you can change your staking
              percentages at any time.

              To begin, review each validator's performance metrics by clicking on their name in the list. When you're
              ready to nominate, add the validators you'd like to nominate to by clicking the "Nominate" button on the
              list or directly on the validatorâ€™s profile. Once you've selected your validators, click the "Proceed"
              button to initiate the nomination process.
