## Contributing to Pioneer

### Setup

Please follow the projects [README](/README.md) to get started.

## Submitting Changes

Please create a pull request from your fork. We may suggest some changes or improvements to make your changes fit overall architecture. However, small fixes or updates should be accepted quickly.

The below guidelines will help you understand what it takes for the PR to be accepted:

- Write tests (when including business logic) or add a storyboook (when you're creating a new component)
- Provide a good PR title – it will be used as a commit message when the PR is merged
- Use GitHub's special keywords to reference and/or close the issue automatically
- Make sure that you've described your assumptions, unusual fixes or other information that may help the reviewer understand your code
- Don't worry about squashing your commits – GitHub will do it for you. However, make your commit history clean as it will be included in the commit description as well.
